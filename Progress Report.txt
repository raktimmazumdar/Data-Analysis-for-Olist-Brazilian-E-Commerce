Customer Dataset- Customer

1. renamed the headers and make them more readable. 
2. performed some minor changes like capitalizing the city names. 

Geolocation dataset- GeoLocation

1. In this dataset there were following columns: zip code, latitude, longitude, city and state names. For the map visualization I was
concerned with zip code(as primary key and also to connect with other dataset like customer and seller datasets), city and names. So, 
deleted the lat and ling columns. This step resulted in duplicate zip codes. So removed the duplicate zip codes in the excel file itself
before importing the data to power bi. This help me to reduce the file size from 42mb to 375kb. 

2. There were multiple same city names with different languages. To rectify that I downloaded all the city names along with the state
names and using power query merging function merged the two separate datasets and corrected the names with the help of fuzzy matching 
function embedded in the merging process. This fuzzy matching process resulted in multiple null values(almost 2k out of 19k) where 
there are no match for current city names and corrected city names. So I got rid of the null values by adding a conditional column 
with the condition: 
new column = current city if corrected city = null, otherwise new column = corrected city.

# ‚≠ê **Data Analysis for Olist (Brazilian E-Commerce)** ‚≠ê

## A. Introduction  

In this project, I have analyzed the data provided and make a dashboard using the 
Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist. Also, I have looked into the company's store performance to bring insights on opportunity to improve overall customer satisfaction.

## B. About the Dataset  

The dataset has information on 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. The orders include details such as order status, price, payment, freight performance to customer location, product attribute, and reviews written by customers. The geolocation data is associated to Brazilian zip codes with latitude and longitude coordinates.

This is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced.

## C. Software Used 

1. Microsoft Excel
2. Microsoft Power BI

## D. Data Reviewing and Cleaning

The dataset has been loaded and processed in the Power Query Editor. In order to facilitate better recognition, I had to promote headers for most of the dataset since Power Query initially struggled to identify them. Additionally, I adjusted the data types for many entries. To enhance clarity and user-friendliness, I replaced technical jargon with more understandable terms, particularly in the "product_category_name_translation" file. 

## E. Data Modelling in Power BI

The tables utilized for this analysis can be linked through a star schema with one Fact Table and five dimension tables. 
However, for the sake of the project three other tables are connect as a snowflake connection to get the desired output. 

1.  *Fact Table:* fact_order_items

2. *Dimension Tables:* dim_reviews, dim_payments, dim_products, dim_sellers, dim_status

3. *Snowflake Tables:* dim_geolocation(connected between dim_seller, dim_customers), dim_customers(connect to dim_geolocation), dim_date(connected to dim_status) 

## *Note:* 
Apart from these tables, there are two more tables in the data model. One with all the measurements created for the project and one table containing product category name translations to simplify the product category names.

The Data Model is shown below:

## F. Data Visualization/ Dashboard in Power BI: 

The dashboard created is shown below-

## G. Report

The findings for the project are as follows- 

1. *Steady Growth:* Revenue has consistently increased over three years, peaking in November 2017, but a notable decline occurred in August and September 2018, warranting further analysis.

2. *Customer Engagement:* Positive customer experiences are evident, with 96K unique customers and an average rating of 4.09 across categories.

3. *Seller Network:* A diverse network of 3,095 sellers across Brazil contributes to a wide product range.

4. *Category Dynamics:* "Bed Bath and Table" dominates orders, while "Health Beauty" and "Watches Gift" lead in revenue.

5. *Regional Performance:* S√£o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Paran√° excel in orders and revenue, highlighting key regional strengths.

6. *Order Patterns:* 60.09% of orders are on weekdays, indicating weekday-focused purchasing behavior.

7. *Customer Concentration:* S√£o Paulo has the most customers, followed by Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte.

8. *Payment Diversity:* Credit cards are favored by most customers, while Boleto and Vouchers also play a significant role.

9. *Timely Deliveries:* 93.23% of orders are delivered on time, contributing to customer satisfaction.

10. *Order Status:* Most orders (97.34%) are successfully completed, addressing the remaining processing and canceled orders can enhance efficiency.


## H. Suggestions

1. *Uncover the Dips:*  Let's dive into the reasons behind the noticeable revenue drop in August and September 2018. By understanding the triggers, we can steer clear of such dips in the future and ensure steady growth.

2. *Nurture Categories:*  We can give some extra attention to categories that might not be shining as brightly. Through well-planned marketing efforts and engaging campaigns, we can bring them back into the spotlight and boost their performance.

3. *Empower Reviews:*  Encouraging customers to share their experiences through reviews can have a ripple effect. Not only will this enhance credibility across categories, but it'll also build a stronger sense of trust with our customer base.

4. *Expand Horizons:*  Exploring new regions where we're not as prominent could be an exciting step. By reaching out to untapped markets, we can broaden our reach and build a fresh customer base.

5. *Weekend Adventure:*  We've noticed a different rhythm in weekend purchasing behavior. Let's create some weekend-specific promotions to tap into this trend and make the most of these windows of opportunity.

6. *Seller Synergy:* Our top-performing sellers are our champions, but we shouldn't forget the others. By offering support and collaboration, we can elevate the offerings of all our sellers, improving our overall marketplace.

7. *Payment Ease:*  More options mean more convenience for our customers. Collaborating with additional payment gateways can make the buying process smoother and more tailored to individual preferences.

8. *Process Precision:*  Our order processing pipeline could use some streamlining. Reducing the percentage of orders in processing status will not only expedite the process but also improve customer satisfaction.

9. *Localize Marketing:*  Different regions have different vibes. Tailoring our marketing strategies to each region's preferences can help us create deeper connections and boost customer acquisition.

10. *Operational Excellence:*  Keeping up our track record of on-time deliveries is crucial. By refining our inventory management and logistics, we can uphold our high standards while also optimizing costs.


## Conclusions: 

Hopefully with these findings and questions answered, I'll be able to help Olist gain better insights into their e-commerce platform and know how to optimize available opportunities for growth. Also, working  with this dataset expanded my understanding of e-commerce business metrics, enhancing my proficiency in Power BI DAX, data modeling and dashboard creation. 

Feel free to explore the merged data and analysis results for a deeper understanding of Telangana's tourism landscape.
